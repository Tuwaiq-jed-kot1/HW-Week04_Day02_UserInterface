# User Interface Project
---
This assignment is for fun and learns some tools in the XML layout.
As shown below, there are two screens of the Instagram app. 

- You need to create the same two screens
  and you need to activate two things in the `Sign-Up
  ` screen and the `Logn-In` screen which are`Log in` Button and  `Sign Up` TextView.
  Thus, when the user clicking on `login button` in the `Sign-Up` screen will go to the `Logn-In` screen
  and when the user clicking on `Sign Up TextView` in the `Logn-In` screen will go to the `Sign-Up` screen.

>Note: You must use `ConstraintLayout` for both screens that you will design them.
